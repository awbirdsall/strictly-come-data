# Strictly Come Data

This is the repository for my exploration of data from Strictly Come Dancing, with posts published to <https://awbirdsall.github.io/strictly-come-data>.

Site generated with Hugo, whose official site has [helpful instructions on hosting on Github Pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/), including how to use `git worktree` to [deploy the published site to a separate `gh-pages` branch](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#deployment-of-project-pages-from-your-gh-pages-branch).
