Welcome to Strictly Come Data! I'm analyzing the data behind the popular BBC programme *Strictly Come Dancing* in a series of posts. Some questions I'm interested in:

- Can I create a model to predict dancers' scores for upcoming weeks of Strictly?
- Can I create a model to predict who will be in the dance-off?

Stay tuned, and keeeeeep data-ing!
