<p>To predict Week 5 Strictly results, I retrained <a href="../predicting-dance-scores-with-ml/">the same three models as I used previously for Week 4</a>, adding in the Week 4 results as additional model inputs. Since this represents a 33% increase in available data about the performance of this series&rsquo; celebrities, I was hopeful the model predictions would improve. However, the week also included two factors that threatened to befuddle the models:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bruno was off for the week, and would be replaced by former <em>Dancing with the Stars</em> champion and <em>Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</em> actor Alfonso Ribeiro (â€”and now I also see on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_Ribeiro">his Wikipedia page</a> current host of <em>America&rsquo;s Funniest Home Videos</em>, which apparently has decided to thumb its nose at the internet and trudge on).</li>
<li>The new &ldquo;couple&rsquo;s choice&rdquo; category had its debut, with two routines in styles never before performed on the show (contemporary and &ldquo;street/commercial&rdquo;).</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite these warning signs, I still went ahead and predicted a score for each routine. Because it did the best last week, I decided to use the XGBoost regressor predictions as the &ldquo;official&rdquo; submission, though cross-validation performance of the plain gradient boosting model appeared on average slightly better than XGBoost, the same as last time.</p>

<p>Additionally, an expert Strictly fan again was willing to share their predicted scores as a point of comparison, for which I am thankful!</p>

<p>I made a few charts to visualize the scoring.</p>

<p>First, a scatter plot to see how predictions compared to actual scoring:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">with</span> sns<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>plotting_context(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;talk&#39;</span>):

<p>Compared to last time, you can see both the expert prediction and the model had a very difficult time predicting scores with a high degree of accuracy. To look at this more quantitatively, I calculated the same measures as last time:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">print</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;number exactly correct:&#39;</span>)

<span style="color:#66d9ef">print</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;------&#39;</span>)

<span style="color:#66d9ef">print</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;r-squared coefficient of correlation:&#39;</span>)

<p>resulting in:</p>

<pre><code>number exactly correct:
fan : 1
gbr : 1
xgbr : 0
rfr : 1
------
root mean square error
fan : 5.7
gbr : 5.5
xgbr : 5.6
rfr : 6.6
------
r-squared coefficient of correlation:
fan : -0.14
gbr : -0.05
xgbr : -0.09
rfr : -0.48
</code></pre>

<p>On all counts, the predictions were <em>less</em> accurate than last time. In fact, the r-squared values were near-zero or somewhat negative, implying no correlation (or even an anti-correlation!) between the predicted and actual scores.</p>

<p>Once again, the gradient boosting regressors performed better than the random forest regressor, though this time the plain gradient boosting was ever-so-slightly better than the XGBoost. The better performance of XGBoost last week may have been just random, since the cross-validation performance of the two weren&rsquo;t all that different. The prediction accuracy of those two models were competitive with the expert fan.</p>

<p>I also plotted the residuals:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">points <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;x&#39;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;.&#39;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;+&#39;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;_&#39;</span>]

<p>The residual plot shows us there was a definite trend in how the predictions were wrong. In all cases, the predictions overestimated the low scores and underestimated the high scores.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not all that surprising this is the way in which the predictions are inaccurate. A score of 20 is low at this point in the competition; it&rsquo;s more plausible to guess the partnership with the 20 would have scored 5 or so points <em>higher</em> than even lower. Similarly, a guess that&rsquo;s off by 5 or 10 points of a score actually in the high 30s <em>must</em> have been an underestimate, since it&rsquo;s impossible to score higher than 40.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the underestimates of the high scores tended to be larger, likely because there were some very high scores from somewhat unexpected dances: Charles and Karen&rsquo;s couple&rsquo;s choice street dance, and Danny and Amy&rsquo;s aviation-themed jive.</p>

<p>A histogram (with kernel density estimates addedâ€”thanks, <code>seaborn</code>!) illustrates a consistent point. The distribution of actual scores was broader than any of the predictions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">with</span> sns<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>plotting_context(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;talk&#39;</span>):

</figure>


<p>So, overall a tough week to predict! I think it&rsquo;s clear why, thoughâ€”many of the scores this week seemed surprising based on how celebrities had done in the past. It also didn&rsquo;t help the machine learning models they were thrown situations for which no data existed (Bruno substitute, new types of dances).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll have to see whether next week, Halloween Week on Strictly, will go any better. It may be spooky, but hopefully there won&rsquo;t be too many scary surprises for the models!</p>
